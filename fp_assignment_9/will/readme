To run the JavaScript version, simply open index.html. It doesn't work
in Internet Explorer, so don't even try IE!

Probably best in Firefox, since it will present you with a dialog
complaining that the script is being too slow, just check the checkbox
to shut it up. Safari has no such checkbox, so you have to click on OK
again and again and again.

To run the Haskell versions, simply do:

$ ghci Queens.lhs
*Queens> solve queens

and for Sudoku:

$ ghci Sudoku.lhs Problems.lhs
*Sudoku> :m + Problems
*Sudoku Problems> solve trivial
*Sudoku Problems> solve profi
*Sudoku Problems> solve diabolical
*Sudoku Problems> solve problem

$ ghci Sudoku.lhs Hutton.lhs
*Sudoku> :m + Hutton
*Sudoku Hutton> solve easy
*Sudoku Hutton> solve gentle
*Sudoku Hutton> solve diabolical
*Sudoku Hutton> solve unsolvable
*Sudoku Hutton> solve minimal
