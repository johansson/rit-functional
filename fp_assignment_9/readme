Will's Solutions

  + See `will` subdirectory and readme in that directory.
  + Has a nice HTML page for testing his JavaScript solution
  + Has a Haskell solution


Joe's Solvers
-------------

Haskell and JavaScript solvers are in the `haskell` and `js` subdirectories
respectively.

To Run the Haskell Puzzles, you can run any of the sample puzzles. Each haskell
file includes a definition of solve (they are identical) for easy loading.

  shell> ghci
  ghci> :l Sudoku
  ghci> solve sudoku
  ...
  
  ghci> :l Queens
  ghci> solve queens
  ...

To Run the JavaScript Puzzles use an appropriate JavaScript Interpreter.
You can also run the files in a browser console (like the Web Inspector
or Firebug).  Assuming you have aliased your JavaScript Interpreter to "js"
you can run the sample puzzles you can just run like so:

NOTE: This immediately runs a simple puzzle. If Rhino's -e worked properly
(like JavaScriptCore's) I would have done this differently.

  shell> js -f solve.js sudoku_puzzle.js
  ...
  
  shell> js -f solve.js queens_puzzle.js
  ...
  
If you want to try specific puzzles you can load up the scripts manually
and test them (some are already provided in variables):

  shell> js
  js> load('solve.js');
  js> load('sudoku_puzzle.js');
  ... /* output from driver */
  js> solve(diabolical);
  ...


Links to JavaScript Interpreters
--------------------------------

All of the following Interpreters support the "-f <file>" command line switch
to interpret a source file and have been tested with our script.

  1. WebKit's JavaScriptCore (C++)
  If you're on Mac OS X you may be able to use the System JS Interpreter:
  /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaScriptCore.framework/Resources/jsc
  Information => http://webkit.org/
  Build Info => http://webkit.org/building/build.html

  2. Mozilla's Spidermonkey (C)
  Information => http://www.mozilla.org/js/spidermonkey/
  Download => http://ftp.mozilla.org/pub/mozilla.org/js/
  Build Info => https://developer.mozilla.org/en/SpiderMonkey_Build_Documentation

  3. Mozilla's Rhino (Java)
  Information => http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/
  Download => http://www.mozilla.org/rhino/download.html

  4. Google's v8 (C++)
  Information => http://code.google.com/p/v8/
  Build Info => http://code.google.com/apis/v8/build.html
