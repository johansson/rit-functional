Running Tests
-------------

We developed a simple testing script. Inside the Literate Haskell Files if you
include a line starting with "@" it is interpreted as a test line! The line
should be believed to evaluate to `True`.

The tests are loaded with our Tester.lhs library.  It includes a couple very,
very basic test functions.

To test an individual file use the `test_runner` shell script:

  shell> ./test_runner
  usage: test_runner [-v] fileName
    -v  echos the test script to the console

  shell> ./test_runner Assignment.lhs
  "PASS"
  "PASS"
  ...
