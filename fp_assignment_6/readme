# Overview

Lambda Interpreter
------------------

Data types, Lambda Operations, and other assignment details are
found in the following Haskell files:

  + Lambda.lhs
    Interpreter given by the professor.

  + LambdaTypes.lhs
    Types given by professor.
    Expanded to implement Show and Read.
  
  + Symbol.lhs
    A Symbol data type that implements Show and Read.
  
  + Assignment.lhs
    Pulls everything together, includes the run() function,
    helpful macros, and statements to test.
  
  + Tester.lhs
    Our testing library, carried over from Assignment #3.


How To Run
----------

The Assignment.lhs file is meant to nicely pull everything in together
so you can test easily with:

  shell> ghci Assignment.lhs

Note that the functions "macros", "s1", "s2", "s3", and "s4" are
available to easily test.


Running Tests
-------------

We developed a simple testing script. Inside the Literate Haskell Files if you
include a line starting with "@" it is interpreted as a test line! The line
should be believed to evaluate to `True`.

The tests are loaded with our Tester.lhs library.  It includes a couple very,
very basic test functions.

To test an individual file use the `test_runner` shell script:

  shell> ./test_runner 
  usage: test_runner [-v] fileName
  	-v	echos the test script to the console

  shell> ./test_runner Assignment.lhs 
  "PASS"
  "PASS"
