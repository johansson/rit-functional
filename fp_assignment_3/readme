# Overview

Loops and Matrix Functions
--------------------------

The Haskell implementations of the assignment are included in their properly
named module files.  Will's implementations are in a separate folder:

  + Matrix.lhs
  + Select.lhs
  + Subset.lhs
  + will
    + Matrix.lhs
    + Select.lhs
    + Subset.lhs

For testing there are a few extra files:

  + run_all_tests.sh (executable)
  + test_runner (executable)
  + Tester.lhs (testing library functions)


Running Tests
-------------

We developed a simple testing script. Inside the Literate Haskell Files if you
include a line starting with "@" it is interpreted as a test line! The line
should be believed to evaluate to `True`.

The tests are loaded with our Tester.lhs library.  It includes a couple very,
very basic test functions.

To test an individual file use the `test_runner` shell script:

  shell> ./test_runner 
  usage: test_runner [-v] fileName
  	-v	echos the test script to the console

  shell> ./test_runner Tester.lhs 
  "PASS"
  "PASS"
  ...

To Run All the tests you can use the included shell script:

  shell> ./run_all_tests.sh

By Default run_all_tests run all the tests verbosely.


Resources Used
--------------

We used no resources other then those listed in the source code and on our
Reading Lists:
