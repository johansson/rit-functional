How To Run The Example
----------------------

  1. Run the Ruby Source through an Interpreter

    shell> ruby bag.rb


Notes on the Interpreter
------------------------

  Ruby should be available on any "sane" machine.  If not a simple Google
  search to get instructions for your platform should suffice.

  Our script has been tested with Both Ruby 1.8 and Ruby 1.9.  Both work.


Overview of the Code
--------------------

  Ruby has "blocks" which are essentially first order functions.  Thus,
  it gets all the benefits of functional languages and its implementation
  of "where", "not", and "join" are very easy.  Its flexible Array
  implementation already provides some useful functional methods such as
  "select" and "map".
