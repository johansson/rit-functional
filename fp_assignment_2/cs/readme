C# version by Will Johansson

This exploits the fact that C# does delegates.

Sorry, this isn't well commented. I was working on a C++ version and gave up because C++ templates were frustrating me. :)

Compile on Linux with mono:

	gmcs *.cs /out:infinite.exe
	mono infinite.exe

Or on Windows:

	mcs /out:infinite.exe
	infinite
