Infinite Lists
--------------

Each directory implements infinite lists, "sequences", in a different language.
There is a "readme" file inside each of these directories providing compilation
or build instructions. The included directories are:

  + haskell
  + java
  + javascript
  + cs


Resources Used
--------------

We used no resources other then those listed in the source code and on our
Reading Lists:
